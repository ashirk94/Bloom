An application to bring people together and form friendships based on common interests and values.

This is my largest scale project yet, and I am working with UX Designer Sarah Martin.

- Instant messaging between users made with the socket.io library.
- Location tracking and distance measuring to pair users based on proximity.
- Matching algorithm designed to connect people based on their ranked interests and values.
